My Tester's Portfolio
# About Me
My name is Bart≈Çomiej Skorobohaty. I have been playing the violin since I was a child. I graduated with honors from the Academy of Music in Bydgoszcz in Poland. Music will always be my passion, but now it's time to change my professional life. I decided to change industries and enter the IT world. I completed the Manual Tester course. I obtained the ISTQB certificate and now I am waiting for further challenges and development opportunities.
